## Why I Started This Blog

I've always wanted a space to share my thoughts, experiences, and things I'm learning. Whether it's coding, tech news, design ideas, or personal reflections, this blog is my corner of the internet.

Over the years, I've kept notes, journaled, and written small articles privately. But now, I want to be more intentional about writing and sharing publicly. If even one person finds these posts helpful or interesting, I'll consider it a win.

## What You Can Expect

Here are a few things I plan to write about:

- Web development (React, Next.js, Node, etc.)
- Design systems, accessibility, and UI best practices
- Tools, workflows, and productivity tips
- Personal growth, career reflections, and tech culture
- Book and article recommendations

I'll aim to keep posts digestible, authentic, and hopefully valuable.

## About Me

I'm a developer, designer, and lifelong learner. I enjoy building things that are beautiful, fast, and useful. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, photography, coffee, and tinkering with side projects.

If you're reading this, thanks for being here! I'd love to hear your thoughts and connect.

## What's Next?

This blog is powered by Next.js and markdown files. That makes writing feel simple and focused - no fancy CMS, just plain text and code. I'll be experimenting with styles, layouts, and content types over time.

Stay tuned for future posts. You can subscribe to updates (soon), or just check back here now and then.

Thanks again for stopping by.

Until next time,  
**Me**
